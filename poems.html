<b>Javelina</b>
<br>
<br>



We return red, dirty, and decidedly content.<br>
Chris is limping and we carry his gear.<br>
With another mat to carry on my small frame<br>
the setting sun turns me into a black box.<br>
<br>
Without fear, or perhaps aware that<br>
we spent our energy pebble wrestling,<br>
the javelina dares to look. To run by us<br>
knowing damn well we won't chase.<br>

<b>Ordeal</b>
<br>
<br>

Into the slot I reach.<br>
Reach and only sand greets me with his panic.<br>
Manic. Deep breaths, glance down, feet flailing.<br>
My mind at odds with the words from the security of the ground.<br>
The sound of beta and spray. Is that French I hear?<br>
<br>
I wipe my hand on my shirt, reach again and improbably the sand has multiplied.<br>
The pump wins and down we ago. Enjoy the ride.<br>

<b>Ole Betsy</b>
<br>
<br>

The name was tongue in cheek, but by the end of the trip she was no joke.<br>
<br>
Fifty miles west of Jasper the tire of my 09 Chevy Aveo blew out. Went kaput. On the side of the highway <br>
in the oppressive southern heat we changed it with one of those spare tires riddled with warnings: <br>
"DO NOT EXCEED FIFTY-FIVE MPH" and "NOT TO BE USED FOR MORE THAN 200 MILES."<br>
We named the tire Ole Betsy and it was her time to shine.<br>
<br>
Only the hubris of teenagers and dreams of witnessing the fitness of a grainy Sharma giving a glorious "pssaaat!" kept us going.<br>
<br>
Down into the canyon we ventured, the highway leading to an unpaved road and finally into the valley.<br>
<br>
For three days we battled with sandstone until finally we had to rely on her one more time<br> 
to get us out of the valley past the unpaved road, and back to the highway &#8212; finally home.<br>
