<b>Javelina</b>
<br>
<br>



We return red, dirty, and decidedly content.<br>
Chris is limping and we carry his gear.<br>
With another mat to carry on my small frame<br>
the setting sun turns me into a black box.<br>
<br>
Without fear, or perhaps aware that<br>
we spent our energy pebble wrestling,<br>
the javelina dares to look. To run by us<br>
knowing damn well we won't chase.<br>
