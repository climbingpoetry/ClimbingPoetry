<b>Javelina</b>
<br>
<br>



We return red, dirty, and decidedly content.<br>
Chris is limping and we carry his gear.<br>
With another mat to carry on my small frame<br>
the setting sun turns me into a black box.<br>
<br>
Without fear, or perhaps aware that<br>
we spent our energy pebble wrestling,<br>
the javelina dares to look. To run by us<br>
knowing damn well we won't chase.<br>

<b>Ordeal</b>
<br>
<br>

Into the slot I reach.<br>
Reach and only sand greets me with his panic.<br>
Manic. Deep breaths, glance down, feet flailing.<br>
My mind at odds with the words from the security of the ground.<br>
The sound of beta and spray. Is that French I hear?<br>
<br>
I wipe my hand on my shirt, reach again and improbably the sand has multiplied.<br>
The pump wins and down we ago. Enjoy the ride.<br>
